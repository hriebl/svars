\title{Moving block bootstrap for IRFs of identified SVARs}
\usage{
mb.boot(x, b.length = 15, horizon, nboot, nc = 1, dd = NULL,
  signrest = NULL, itermax = 300, steptol = 200, iter2 = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SVAR object of class "svars"}

\item{b.length}{Length of each block}

\item{horizon}{Time horizon of impulse response functions}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap iterations}

\item{nc}{Number of processor cores (Not available on windows machines)}

\item{dd}{Object of class 'indepTestDist'. A simulated independent sample of the same size as the data.
If not supplied, it will be calculated by the function}

\item{signrest}{A list with vectors containing 1 and -1, e.g. c(1,-1,1), indicating a sign pattern of specific shocks to be tested
with the help of the bootstrap samples.}

\item{itermax}{Maximum number of iterations for DEoptim}

\item{steptol}{Tolerance for steps without improvement for DEoptim}

\item{iter2}{Number of iterations for the second optimization}
}
\value{
A list of class "sboot" with elements
\item{boot_mean}{Mean of bootstrapped covariance decompositions}
\item{sign_complete}{Frequency of bootstrapped covariance decompositions which conform the complete predetermined sign pattern. If signrest=NULL,
 the frequency of bootstrapped covariance decompositions that hold the same sign pattern as the point estimate is provided.}
\item{sign_part}{Frequency of single shocks in all bootstrapped covariance decompositions which accord to a specific predetermined sign pattern
