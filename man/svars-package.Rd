\title{Data-driven identification of structural VAR models}
\description{
  This package implements data-driven identification methods for structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. Based on an existing VAR model object, the structural impact matrix B may be obtained via changes in volatility, least dependent innovations or non-Gaussian maximum likelihood.\cr
  }
\details{
  The main functions to retrieve structural impact matrices are:
    \tabular{ll}{
      \code{id.cv} \tab Identification via changes in volatility,
    }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{id.nglm} \tab Identification via Non-Gaussian maximum likelihood,
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{id.dc} \tab Independence-based identification of SVAR models based on distance covariances,
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{id.cvm} \tab Independence-based identification of SVAR models based on Cramer-von Mises distance.
  }
  \tabular{ll}{
    \code{id.st} \tab Identification by means of smooth transition in covariance.
  }

  All of these functions require an estimated var object. Currently the classes 'vars' and 'vec2var' from the \code{vars} package,     'nlVar', which includes both VAR and VECM, from the \code{tsDyn} package as well as the list from \code{MTS} package are supported.
  Besides these core functions, additional tools to calculate confidence bands for impulse response functions using
  bootstrap techniques as well as the Chow-Test for structural change are implemented. The \code{USA} dataset is used to showcase the
  functionalities in examples throughout the package.
